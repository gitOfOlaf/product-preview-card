## my-process

I built this starting from desktop and then optimizing for mobile experience (desktop-first workflow)

## built-with

This was entirely built with:

- HTML
- CSS
- FLEXBOX
- DESKTOP FIRST WORKFLOW
- JAVASCRIPT

## what-i-learned

I learned alot of things, and I'm very surprised that this was tagged newbie and it kicked my ass a bit.
some of the things I learnt, which I don't normally do in my normal project, was to change images on media queries (relatively easy).

I also improved my skill on mobile responsiveness amongst others
